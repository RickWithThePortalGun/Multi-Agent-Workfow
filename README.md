**A simulation providing how this multi-agent workflow would behave under test.**

Topic Input: "Artificial Intelligence"
Researcher Agent:
Receives the topic "Artificial Intelligence"
Generates ideas for teaching someone new to the subject:
"Define AI and its applications"
"Explain machine learning concepts"
"Discuss AI ethics and challenges"
Response: "Develop ideas for teaching someone new to the subject 'Artificial Intelligence': Define AI and its applications, Explain machine learning concepts, Discuss AI ethics and challenges"

Writer Agent:
Receives the ideas from the Researcher
Writes a piece of text to explain the topic using one of the ideas:
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. AI has numerous applications in industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation."
Response: "Use one of these ideas to write a piece of text to explain Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems... (full text)"

Examiner Agent:
Receives the written text from the Writer
Crafts 2-3 test questions to evaluate understanding of the text:
"What is the primary goal of developing Artificial Intelligence systems?"
"Which industries are likely to benefit from AI applications?"
"What is an example of a task that requires human intelligence, now performed by AI systems?"
Response: "Crafts 2-3 test questions to evaluate understanding of this writing: What is the primary goal of developing Artificial Intelligence systems?, Which industries are likely to benefit from AI applications?, What is an example of a task that requires human intelligence, now performed by AI systems?"

This simulation demonstrates how the code would run, with each agent performing its designated task and generating responses based on the input topic.
